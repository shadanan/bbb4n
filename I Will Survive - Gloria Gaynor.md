# I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor

## Intro
 
c1: E7

## Verse
 
c1:    Am                        Dm
l1: At first I was afraid, I was petrified,

c1:               G                              Cmaj7
l1: Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side.

c1:            Fmaj7                          Bm7b5
l1: But then I spent so many nights, thinking how you did me wrong,

c1:            Esus4                 E
l1: And I grew strong; and I learned how to get along.

c1:                Am               Dm
l1: But now you're back, from outer space,

c1:               G                                   Cmaj7
l1: I just walked in, to find you here, with that sad look upon your face.

c1:               Fmaj7
l1: I should have changed that stupid lock,

c1:               Bm7b5
l1: I should have made you leave your key,

c1:          Esus4                               E
l1: If I had known for just one second, you'd be back to bother me.

## Chorus
 
c1:            Am               Dm
l1: Go on now, go; walk out the door;

c1:             G                          Cmaj7
l1: Just turn a-round now, 'cos you're not welcome any more.

c1: Fmaj7                             Bm7b5
l1:  Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?

c1:                   Esus4                      E
l1: Did you think I'd crumble; did you think I'd lay down and die?

c1:            Am            Dm
l1: Oh no, not I; I will sur-vive,

c1:        G                             Cmaj7
l1: Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive.

c1:          Fmaj7                             Bm7b5
l1: I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give,

c1:              Esus4            E                Am
l1: And I'll sur-vive, I will sur-vive, I will sur-vive...

## Verse
 
c1:          Am                                 Dm

c1:                G                             Cmaj7
l1: Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart.

c1:             Fmaj7                            Bm7b5
l1: And I spent oh, so many nights, just feeling sorry for myself,

c1:           Esus4          E7
l1: I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high.

c1:             Am           Dm

c1:              G                                  Cmaj7
l1: I'm not that chained up little person, still in love with you.

c1:            Fmaj7                             Bm7b5
l1: And so you felt like dropping in and just ex-pect me to be free,

c1:               Esus4                          E
l1: Well, now I'm saving all my loving, for some-one who's loving me.
